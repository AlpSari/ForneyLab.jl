ForneyLab.jl
============

Forney-style Factor Graph framework in Julia.
**This software is still in an early development stage**.

Installation
============
Add the ForneyLab package to your Julia installation:
```jl
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/spsbrats/ForneyLab.jl.git")
```
To update an already installed package, use:
```jl
Pkg.update()
```
Usage
=====
Import ForneyLab:
```jl
using ForneyLab
```
Once imported, one can create nodes and edges to build a factor graph, or create custom node and message types. There are demos available [online](http://192.71.151.86/ForneyLab.jl-demos/) to get you started.
