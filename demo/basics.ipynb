      "============================\n",
      "This tutorial will show the basic types and functionality of the ForneyLab.jl toolbox. ForneyLab.jl is a toolbox for message passing in Forney style factor graphs (FFG). The FFG representation is convenient when working with message passing algorithms, and can represent complex signal processing systems in an intuitive manner. We assume the reader has basic knowledge of message passing algorithms and factor graphs. \n",
      "\n",
      "The toolbox is written in Julia and designed to be fast, extendible and modular. For more information on Julia you can visit the [Julia website](http://julialang.org/). If you are following this tutorial online you do not need to install Julia. However, for working with the ForneyLab.jl toolbox on your own machine you will need to install Julia (v.0.3). Installation instructions can be found on the Julia webpage and the `README.md` file."

      "--------------------\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### FactorGraph\n",
      "The highest level type in ForneyLab is `FactorGraph`, which holds (among other stuff) a list of edges and nodes. A `FactorGraph` is automatically created in the background when you construct edges. It's also possible to create a `FactorGraph` manually:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jl\n",
      "my_graph = FactorGraph()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "There is always one 'current' graph. If you add edges or nodes, these are automatically added to the current graph. To get an explicit handle to the current graph (not necessary most of the time), use:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jl\n",
      "my_graph = getCurrentGraph()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "To make another graph active, use:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jl\n",
      "setCurrentGraph(FactorGraph())\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Nodes\n",
      "Every node type inherits from an abstract `Node` type. Every specific node type has a number (>= 1) of interfaces, and can optionally be given a name. Interfaces can be used to connect the node to other nodes by edges. The following node types are built into the framework:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `AdditionNode`\n",
      "* `TerminalNode`\n",
      "* `EqualityNode`\n",
      "* `FixedGainNode`\n",
      "* `GaussianNode`\n",
      "\n",
      "Every node type is implemented in a separate file, which also contains detailed information about the node properties.\n",
      "For every node type, there is at least one `updateNodeMessage!(...)` method that accepts a node of that type as argument. This update function holds the node function, specifying how to calculate an outbound message (on a specified interface) from the inbound messages. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Composite nodes\n",
      "\n",
      "Composite nodes contain an internal graph themselves. Upon contruction, the option `use_composite_update_rules` decides whether this internal graph is created explicitly, or if a set of shortcut rules is used corresponding with the node function of the composite node as a whole (making the composite node behave as a standard node). At the moment the toolbox provides the following composite nodes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `GainAdditionCompositeNode`\n",
      "* `GainEqualityCompositeNode`\n",
      "\n",
      "A composite node may itself contain composite nodes, making the toolbox highly modular and extendible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Interfaces\n",
      "An `Interface` is a half-edge that belongs to a `Node`, and carries an outgoing message from that node. Every `Node` has at least one `Interface`. Two interfaces of different nodes can be connected to form an `Edge`. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Edges\n",
      "Two interfaces of different nodes can be partnered to form an `Edge`. The constructor of `Edge` takes two `Interface` instances as arguments and connects them. Optionally, it also takes the distribution type of the variable that the edge represents. This distribution type is used when calculating marginal distributions. The edge direction is defined to be from the first towards the second argument. If a node has just one interface or if all interfaces have the same role (i.e. in an equality node), one can pass the node instead of a specific interface to `Edge()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Messages\n",
      "A `Message` is sent over edges and contains a `ProbabilityDistribution` as payload. A `Message` is parametrized by its payload type. Some examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `Message{GaussianDistribution}`\n",
      "* `Message{GammaDistribution}`\n",
      "* `Message{InverseDistribution}`\n",
      "* `Message{DeltaDistribution{Float64}}`\n",
      "\n",
      "Probability distributions are allowed to have different parameterizations. A Gaussian distribution for example can be defined using it's mean and covariance $(m, V)$, mean and precision $(m, W)$ or weighted mean and precision $(\\xi, W)$."

However, this node specific method is not publicly accessible.

In general, a message passing schedule is required to resolve the dependencies between messages.\n",
