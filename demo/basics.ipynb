     "source": "ForneyLab.jl basics tutorial\n============================\nThis tutorial will show the basic types and functionality of the ForneyLab.jl toolbox. ForneyLab.jl is a toolbox for message passing in Forney style factor graphs (FFG). The FFG representation is convenient when working with message passing algorithms, and can represent complex signal processing systems in an intuitive manner. We assume the reader has basic knowledge of message passing algorithms and factor graphs. \n\nThe toolbox is written in Julia and designed to be fast, extendible and modular. For more information on Julia you can visit the [Julia website](http://julialang.org/). If you are following this tutorial online you do not need to install Julia. However, for working with the ForneyLab.jl toolbox on your own machine you will need to install Julia (v.0.2.1). Installation instructions can be found on the Julia webpage and the `README.md` file."

     "source": "Basic type structure\n--------------------\n---\n### Interfaces\nWe begin by introducing the `Interface` type. An interface is a half-edge that belongs to a node, and carries an outgoing message from that node. It can be seen as a connector that fits with any other interface carrying the same message type. The interface concept allows us to work very modular, allowing us to replacing one node with another (maybe even complexer) node without any structural adaptations.\n\n### Edges\nAn interface can have a partner from which a node receives an incoming message. An interface together with its partner form an `Edge`. An `Edge` is a type that takes two `Interface` types as arguments and connects them. The edge direction is defined from the first to the second argument.\n\n### Messages\nEvery specific message type inherits from the abstract `Message` type. Currently there are two specific message types. The file `messages.jl` in the toolbox source code holds the message type definitions and detailed explanations.\n\n* `GeneralMessage`\n* `GaussianMessage`\n\n### Nodes\nEvery specific node type in the toolbox inherits from an abstract `Node` type. Each specific node type has a specified number (>= 1) of interfaces, and can optionally be given a name. Below is a list with all available node types, each defined in a separate file. The files themselves contain detailed information about the node properties.\n\n* `AdditionNode`\n* `ConstantNode`\n* `EqualityNode`\n* `FixedGainNode`\n\nAnother requirement for nodes is that each node type has an `updateNodeMessage!(...)` function that accepts a node of that type as argument. This update function holds the node function, specifying how to calculate an outbound message (on a specified interface) from the inbound messages. \n\n### Composite nodes\n\nComposite nodes contain an internal graph themselves. Upon contruction, the option `use_composite_update_rules` decides whether this internal graph is created explicitly (rendering the composite node just a shell), or if a set of shortcut rules is used corresponding with the node function of the composite node as a whole (making the composite node behave as a standerd node). At the moment the toolbox provides the following composite nodes:\n\n* `GainEqualityCompositeNode`\n\nA composite node may itself contain composite nodes, making the toolbox highly modular and extendible.\n"

The `calculateMessage!(...)` function makes a recursive call on the interfaces that do not yet carry an inbound message that is required for the calculation of the message on the outbound interface. When the required inbound messages are available, `calculateMessage!(...)` calls the node specific `updateNodeMessage!(...)` to calculate the outbound message.\n\nFor convenience, there are also `calculateForwardMessage!(...)` and `calculateBackwardMessage!(...)` that both take an edge as argument."
