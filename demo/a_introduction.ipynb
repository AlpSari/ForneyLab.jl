    "\n",
    "### Why ForneyLab?\n",
    "- We required a flexible toolbox for performing message passing on Forney-style factor graphs\n",
    "- At the time no principled toolbox for message passing on FFGs was available\n",
    "- If you want to really understand how something works, then build it yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "### ForneyLab is:\n",
    "- A toolbox for deriving message passing solutions to inference problems\n",
    "- Practical, while retaining maximal flexibility\n",
    "- Extensible at all levels (nodes, update rules, algorithms, inference engines)\n",
    "- A program that builds custom inference programs\n",
    "\n",
    "### ForneyLab is not:\n",
    "- A high-performance inference framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ForneyLab approach to solving inference problems:\n",
    "1. Build (the generative model)\n",
    "2. Schedule (the message passing algorithm)\n",
    "3. Infer (the marginal distributions)"
