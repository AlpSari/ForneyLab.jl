      "A composite node is a node that can be represented by an internal graph itself. The ForneyLab framework has several composite nodes already built in, these can be found in the `src/nodes/composite` directory. All composite node types inherit from an abstract `CompositeNode` type, that itself inherits from abstract `Node`. An example of a composite node is the `GainEqualityCompositeNode` depicted below.\n",

      "The outer box represents the exterior of the composite node. In this case there are three interfaces, `in1`, `in2` and `out` that can connect to other external nodes. The composite node allows us to model the behaviour of multiple internal nodes as one. Through this aggregation we can write shortcut update rules that are mathematically or computationally more efficient than would be the case if we viewed the internal nodes separately. The composite node also allows us to work in a modular fashion. It allows us to simply replace a composite node with another node without altering the rest of the graph. The fact that composite nodes can be nested means that it becomes easy to build complex graphs."

      "Let's assume we want to calculate a message on the `out` interface by using explicit internal message passing. When we call `updateNodeMessage!(out)`, ForneyLab recognizes the `out` interface as belonging to a composite node. First, it requires that the user specified schedule (or the schedule created by `generateSchedule()`) already calculated the incoming messages on `in1` and `in2`. Next, `updateNodeMessage!(out)` calls an internal message passing scheme that is defined in `out.internal_schedule`. This internal schedule will call `updateNodeMessage(eq_out)`. This collects the incoming messages on `in1` and `in2`, and calculates the outgoing message on the `eq_out` interface. Next, the internal schedule will call `updateNodeMessage!(out')` to calculate the outbound message on `out'`. Finally, a pointer to this outbound message on `out'` is stored on the `out` interface."
